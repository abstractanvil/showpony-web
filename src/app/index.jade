        | ShowPony is an instrumental math rock band hailing from Washington, DC.
        | Their debut LP, 
        a(href="music.html") Slow Danger
        | , highlights their complicated-rock tendencies
        | with elaborate song composition and intricate syncopation.
        | In the summer of 2015, the band hit the road with stops in Canada and the midwest,
        | playing songs from their first album and road-testing new songs for
        | an upcoming full-length album.

      p
        | Brian Moran drives the songs along, drumming the thin line between hard-hitting power
        | and subtle nuance, while Eric Sakmar adds his prog-rock prowess to the mix
        | with enough bass force to shake the glasses off of your face. On guitar,
        |   Dan Spagaire pulls from his Pittsburgh upbringing and fondness for loop
        | pedals as his fingers fly, providing angular melodies and classic-grit riffs.

      p
        | Blending math, classic, pop, post, and prog rock together, ShowPony offers an
        | exciting live show full of contagious energy feeding off the enjoyment
        | these three members get from playing music. Local concert reviewer
        | <a href="http://dcrocklive.blogspot.com/2013/04/tarrtufi-showpony-appomattox-ghion-apr.html"> David
        | Hintz</a> describes a ShowPony show - "&#8230;the guitarist created intriguing
        | patterns over countering bass runs atop crisp snare and cymbal attacks.
        | The music is mobile with some jagged cuts as an ice skater may fly by
        | leaving a crystal trail."

        | ShowPony is currently finalizing material for their full-length follow up to <a href="music.html">Slow Danger</a>.
